## Our Game - Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock (RPSLS)

Inspired by the classic tiebreaker game. As fans of the Big Bang Theory, we have added the options of 'lizard' and 'Spock'. This doesn't make the game much harder, as famously put by Sheldon Cooper: <br>

> It's very simple. Scissors cuts paper. Paper covers rock. Rock crushes lizard. Lizard poisons Spock. Spock smashes scissors. Scissors decapitates lizard. Lizard eats paper. Paper disproves Spock. Spock vaporizes rock. And as it always has, rock crushes scissors.

We appreciate that might be a lot to take in, so here is a helpful infographic: <br>

As a reminder, to play just run <br> `npm start` <br>
We hope you enjoy! **GLHF**!

## Next Phase of Development - Game Tracking Webpage

We are currently working on a new feature that tracks the games a user has played, removing the need to scroll through the text in the console you are playing in. The desired result will look something like this mockup: <br>

We're hoping to have this page up and running as soon as possible!
