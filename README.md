## Game 1 - Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock

Our first installment is inspired by the classic tiebreaker game. As fans of the Big Bang Theory, we have added the options of 'lizard' and 'Spock'. This doesn't make the game much harder, as famously put by Sheldon Cooper: <br>

> It's very simple. Scissors cuts paper. Paper covers rock. Rock crushes lizard. Lizard poisons Spock. Spock smashes scissors. Scissors decapitates lizard. Lizard eats paper. Paper disproves Spock. Spock vaporizes rock. And as it always has, rock crushes scissors.

We appreciate that might be a lot to take in, so here is a helpful infographic: <br>
